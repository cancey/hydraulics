This folder contains notebooks where we study flood dynamics.

# GC_KinematicWave
This notebook uses the kinematic wave approximation. A boundary value problem is solved. An hydrograph is imposed to the flume inlet. We compute the hydrographs at different positions and compare with the Kleitz-Seddon equation.

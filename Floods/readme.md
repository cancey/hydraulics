This folder contains notebooks where we study flood dynamics.

## Kinematic Wave
This notebook uses the kinematic wave approximation. A boundary value problem is solved. An hydrograph is imposed to the flume inlet. We compute the hydrographs at different positions and compare with the Kleitz-Seddon equation.

## Flume
Solution to the shallow water equations for open channel flow

We solve the shallow water equations.
The geometry studied is that shown in figure 5.57 (see lecture notes, [fr.ancey.ch/cours/bachelor/cours-meca.pdf](http://fr.ancey.ch/cours/bachelor/cours-meca.pdf)) with:
* a bed slope $i=0.2$% for the main channel (from $x=10$ m to 1000 m) and a slope $i=5$% for the entrance channel (from $x=0$ m to 10 m)
* Ch√©zy friction with $C=50$ m$^{1/2}\cdot$s$^{-1}$
* a gate (height $h=2$ m) is opened and a constant flow rate $q=10$ m$^2$/s is established.
The water flows down the steep channel ($i=5$%), then down the main channel ($i=0.2$%), which ends in a sill 50 cm high.
Note the formation of a hydraulic jump upstream of the main channel. The water depth tends to be constant, with a portion corresponding to the normal height $h_n=2.71$ m.

Introduction to the shallow water equations

You will a collection of jupyter notebooks, Fortran and Python scripts for simulating hydraulic processes. In most cases, computations are done using Clawpack. Clawpack can be installed on any linux and MacOs machine (it should be possible with Windows, but I have never tested). See:

[www.clawpack.org/installing.html](https://www.clawpack.org/installing.html)

Clawpack is a library for solving hyperbolic equations. Theory and numerical techniques are developed in:

LeVeque, R.J., *Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems*, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2002.

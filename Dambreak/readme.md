In this folder, we study dambreak flows.

##  Huppert's Problem
We solve Huppert's equation (release of a finite volume of a Newtonian fluid down an inclined plane).

## Ritter's solution
Ritter's solution to the Saint-Venant equations for dry frictionless bottoms

## Wet bed problem
Solution to the dambreak problem for wet channels

## Sloping bed
Solution to the dambreak problem for a sloping bed (finite volume, Manning-Strickler friction)

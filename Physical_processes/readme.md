A collection of notebooks to illustrate advection and diffusion

# Contents

## GC_burgers
Solution to the burgers equation subject to the initial condition $u(x,0)=sin(\pi x)$.

## GC_burgers_CI
Solution to the burgers equation and comparison with an exact solution. See lecture notes [fr.ancey.ch/cours/masterGC/cours-hydraulique.pdf](http://fr.ancey.ch/cours/masterGC/cours-hydraulique.pdf), ยง 1.6.3.

## GC_advection
Solution to the linear advection equation subject to an initial condition and comparison with exact solution.

## GC_nonlinear_advection
Solution to a nonlinear advection equation subject to a boundary condition.

## GC_ViscousBurgers
Solution to the viscous Burgers equation. The homogeneous equation is solved using a finite-volume scheme, and it is updated using the Crank-Nicolson method.
